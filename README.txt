Hello! This is my first assignment with Python. Even though I have had little time due to my busy exam schedule recently, I wanted to try something new.
Unfortunately, I encountered a technical issue and lost all of my four-day progress because I was working in an online editor and had to restart the code.
Despite this setback, I did my best to capture what I believe is the essence of the assignment.
I hope you enjoy the analysis. 
I truly appreciate your course's teaching and would love to receive some ideas on how I can improve this assignment further.
Best regards,
